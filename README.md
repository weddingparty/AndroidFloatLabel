# Goals for this project

Having goals for a project, keep a quality check and help with learning. Since I intended this to be a community project, the goals are aligned, keeping that fact in mind. The goals for this project are as follows:

1. Code should be ridiculously readable. Must read as fluently as pseudocode.
2. Code must be tested
3. Git commits should be clean and legible. Try to [follow AngularJs commit types](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).
4. Super DRY code! You cannot have two sets of lines repeating within the same file.
